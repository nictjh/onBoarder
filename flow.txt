For ticketing:

2 Tables??: 
1 for the normal input 

This info from first table will send to pending
then after I will keep check of pending and send to my main admin user to verify before putting it into my dictionary




Current Databases:
1. dictionary 
2. tele-user
3. pending


The plan:
- Can add a function to move words to from a specific table to another
- Add a function to remove words from specific table
- Add a delete row function


What do I need in my pending table?
- submittedText 
- userName
- user_id
** Can allow for duplicates


*Send out message immediately after it enters pending to admin
handle duplicates? 
- Maybe I pop the first row ?
- Map the broadcast call onto all my data points?

broadcast_ticket() -> 
1. Get my case details
2. Send message to admin
