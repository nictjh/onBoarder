# onBoarder
`onBoarder` is a Data Dictionary Chatbot designed to assist new interns and staff by clarifying terms and acronyms they encounter in their new work environment. This bot operates independently of external AI services like OpenAI for basic term clarifications, ensuring real-time responsiveness and reliability. However, for in-depth explanations, `onBoarder` integrates OpenAI's capabilities to provide comprehensive insights into each term or acronym.

## Key Features
### Current Features
- **Acronym Deciphering**: Quickly explains acronyms to users, helping them understand company-specific terminology without delay.
- **Real-time Updating**: Ensures that all information provided is up-to-date by reflecting real-time changes made to the source tables.
- **Term Submission**: Allows users to submit tickets for new terms that are not currently in the database, facilitating continuous growth and relevance of the data dictionary.
- **Admin Authorization**: Enables admins to review and authorize submitted tickets, maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the information.
- **Term Explanation**: Provides detailed explanations of terms using OpenAI's capabilities to enhance understanding.

### Planned Features
- **Extended Information**: In future updates, the bot will provide detailed explanations about terms, not just acronyms, enriching the learning curve for new hires. This will be integrated into the Acronym Deciphering feature. (No Deadline)
- **Mass Database Updates**: Super admins will be able to perform bulk uploads to the database, significantly streamlining the process of updating and maintaining the data dictionary. (To be Done by End July 2024)
